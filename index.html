<p> I’m in the School of Computing and Information studying Digital Narrative and Interactive Design, a joint degree program that combines computer science with writing, design, and storytelling. I’m also pursing an Information System Design certificate and a Computer Science minor. I’ve done all sorts of work, ranging from Python projects, to narrative soundscapes, to Usability testing. </P>
