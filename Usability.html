        <p>  My usability testing experience mostly comes from working in a class at Pitt
          called ENGCMP 1430: Usability Testing in Professional Writing Envrionments with
          Dr. Stephen Quigley. It was a really great class where I learned a lot about the 
          importance of usability in our growing technical space. We utilized design heuristics 
          as well as automated tools including Lighthouse to evaluate and assess the accessibility 
          and usability of different websites, culminating in a report and presentation for a real
          client here at the University of Pittsburgh.
