        Sound editing is a little out of my comfort zone, but this semester I became
        proficient in the sound-editing software Audacity. I used the software to
        create a narrative soundscape that tells a ~spooky~ story. I used basic tools like
        splitting, cutting, and joining, and also more advanced tools like distortion, pitching,
        and ducking. I'm definitely open to experiment with sound design and editing in the future, 
        if the occassion ever arises
        <br></br></p>
      <p>The narration was done by myself and a friend, and the sound effects are a mix of 
        original free-to-use sounds. The soundscape is embedded here, but to get the 
        orginal file or see more of the process,
