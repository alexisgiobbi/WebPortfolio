# WebPortfolio

I chose to do a job-seeking portfolio. My site contains work I have done for this class, like my soundscape and my visual argument, and also work I have done for my other classes. I have solely utilized HTML and CSS to create my portfolio, and it was a great way to compile all my work together.

#### I have mainly tested using Google Chrome, and then briefly on Microsoft Edge and Firefox. I don't have Safari on my laptop, so I haven't tested it there.
